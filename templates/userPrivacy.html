            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>4. How do we ensure that our processing systems remain confidential, resilient, and available?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A. SUMMARY</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                We implement various measures to ensure that our processing systems remain confidential, resilient, and available. We commit to maintaining strong physical and logical access controls and conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>B. LEARN MORE</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Every part of the website utilizes properly-provisioned, redundant servers (e.g., multiple load balancers, web servers, replica databases) in case of failure. We take servers out of operation as part of regular maintenance without impacting availability.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Only designated, authorized operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an as-needed basis behind a two-factor authenticated virtual private network. Specific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored in a secure and encrypted location.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>5. Do we use cookies?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A. SUMMARY</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. You can choose to disable cookies, but if you do, your ability to use or access certain parts of the website may be affected.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                We use cookies and other similar identifiers to understand and save your preferences for future visits, to advertise to you on other sites, and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

            <p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to reject the setting of cookies. However, if you choose to disable cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of our website.

            <p>
                Our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites and to count users who have visited those websites. We may also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters, to determine whether and when you open and act on them.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. This helps us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on the FM website results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's website.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Finally, our website may contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers that help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations. These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites or other products.

                Personal data collected by FM may be stored and processed in the United States, China, or in any other country where FM or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities.

            <p>10. Data Retention</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A. SUMMARY</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                We may retain your personal information as long as you continue to use the website, have an account with us, or for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy. You can ask to close your account by contacting us as described above, and we will delete your personal information on request. We may, however, retain personal information for an additional period as is permitted or required under applicable laws, for legal, tax, or regulatory reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to make the website available to you, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different types of data, actual retention periods can vary significantly. The criteria we use to determine the retention periods include:
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                ●&nbsp;How long is the personal data needed to make the website available to you and/or operate our business? This includes things such as maintaining and improving the performance of the website, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. This is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                ●&nbsp;Is there an automated control, such as in your user dashboard, that enables you to access and delete the personal data at any time? If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>●&nbsp;Is the personal data of a sensitive type? If so, a shortened retention time would generally be appropriate.</p>

            <p>12.  California Resident Rights</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                If you are a California resident, you have the rights outlined in this section. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of your personally-identifiable data will control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at support@fmg.art.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Exercising Your Rights</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Please follow the instructions and requirements described below when submitting your requests. Requests that fail to comply with any of these instructions and requirements may result in delayed or no response.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                To exercise the rights described below as a California resident, you must send us a request (1) that provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that (i) you are the person about whom we have collected personal data, (ii) you, as the requester, are the same person as the data subject for whose information you’re requesting (or such person’s parent/guardian), (2) that describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it, (3) that declares, under the penalty of perjury, that you’re exercising your rights under the CCPA as a California resident solely for lawful purposes, and (4) in a way that does not and would not unduly burden or otherwise abuse our data request system and/or our website. Each request that meets all of these criteria, and which is confirmed via email verification, will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to determine whether a request may be for harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable purposes, and we reserve the right not to respond to such request. We will only use your personal data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account on the website to submit a Valid Request.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:</p>
            <p>Email us at support@fmg.art</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Access</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your personal data over the past 12 months. In response to a Valid Request, we will provide you with the following information:

            <p>●&nbsp;The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your personal data.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>●&nbsp;The specific pieces of Personal Data that you explicitly requested and that we have collected about you.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                ●&nbsp;If we have disclosed your personal data to any third parties for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of personal data shared with each category of third party recipient. 
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Deletion</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                You have the right to request that we delete the personal data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions. For example, we may need to retain your personal data to provide you with access to the website or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request. 
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We Do Not Sell Your Personal Data</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our products or services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of personal data that we receive from you.
