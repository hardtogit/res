            <p>FM Gallery is a website that provides users with the opportunity to purchase, collect, and showcase digital and physical artworks.  </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                FM Fund Limited ("FM", "we", or "us") is making the website available to you. Before you use the website, however, you will need to agree to these Terms of Use and any terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference (collectively, these “Terms").

IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITY’S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP AVAILABLE TO YOU.

            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION PROVISION (SEE SECTION 15).  PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY, SINCE  IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>1. THE APP</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                A. To most easily use the website, you should first install a web browser (such as the Google Chrome web browser).  You will also need to use a supported electronic wallet, which will enable you to purchase and store collectibles that you collect or purchase via the website.  Each collectible is a Non-Fungible Token (an “NFT”) on the [(${TOKEN})]™ blockchain network (“[(${TOKEN})]”).  You can use your electronic to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using your credit card, or via one or more cryptocurrencies that FM may elect to accept from time to time. 
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                B. Transactions that take place on the website are managed and confirmed via the [(${TOKEN})] blockchain.  You understand that your [(${TOKEN})] public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the website.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                C. We neither own nor control any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the website. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties. 
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                D. You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the website. By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete account information about yourself, and to maintain and promptly update as necessary your account information. You are responsible for the security of your account and your electronic wallets. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at support@fmg.art. 
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>2.  EARNING, PURCHASING, AND COLLECTING YOUR MOMENTS</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                A.  The website allows you to purchase, collect, and showcase FM fragments (each, a “Fragment”).  Each Fragment is a non-fungible token (an “NFT”) on the [(${TOKEN})] blockchain.  Each Fragment is comprised of part of a specific artwork, and has a defined set of attributes – including, among other things, scarcity – which help determine the value of the Fragment.  That said, the value of each Fragment is inherently subjective: some collectors might prefer to have a Fragment featuring Hello Kitty, while another might prefer an equivalent Fragment featuring Doraemon.  Each artwork can have more than one Fragment associated with them, and those Fragments will each have different content, scarcity and attributes.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                B. You can earn Fragments for free by participating in certain challenges or marketing campaigns, or by completing certain in-website tasks that FM may make generally available from time to time. You may also be able to purchase the Fragment Blind Box directly in the website.  There are different types of Fragment Blind Boxes available for purchase on the website, and we reserve the right to modify the types and numbers of Blind Boxes available at our discretion. Depending on the type of Blind Box you buy, you will collect Fragments of varying levels of scarcity.  Before you buy a Blind Box, we will let you know the types of Fragments (but not the exact Fragments) that are contained in that Blind Box. 
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>3.  PAYMENTS; GAS FEES; TAXES</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                A. Any financial transactions that you engage in via the website will be conducted solely through the [(${TOKEN})] network.  We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the website, or any other transactions that you conduct via the [(${TOKEN})] network. We do not provide refunds for any purchases that you might make on or through the website – whether for Fragments, Blind Boxes, or anything else.  
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                B. You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with your use of the website. Except for income taxes levied on FM, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms. 
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                C. [(${TOKEN})] requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the [(${TOKEN})] network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized [(${TOKEN})] network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the website. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in these Terms, you will be responsible to pay any Gas Fee for any transaction that occurs via the website.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>4.  OWNERSHIP; LICENSE; RESTRICTIONS</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this Section 4, the following capitalized terms will have the following meanings: </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                “Art” means any art, design, and drawings (in any form or media, including, without limitation, video or photographs) that may be associated with a Fragment that you Own.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                “Own” means, with respect to a Fragment, a Fragment that you have purchased or otherwise rightfully acquired from a legitimate source, where proof of such purchase is recorded on the [(${TOKEN})] blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“Purchased Fragment” means a Fragment that you Own.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                “Third Party IP” means any third party patent rights (including, without limitation, patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other intellectual property rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the world.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>B. Ownership.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                i. You Own the NFT.  Each Fragment is a non-fungible token (an “NFT”) on the [(${TOKEN})] blockchain.  When you purchase a Fragment, you own the underlying NFT completely.  This means that you have the right to trade your NFT, sell it, or give it away. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the [(${TOKEN})] network: at no point will we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Fragment. 
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                ii. FM Owns the website.  You acknowledge and agree that FM (or, as applicable, our licensors) owns all legal right, title and interest in and to all other elements of the website, and all intellectual property rights therein (including, without limitation, all Art, designs, systems, methods, information, computer code, software, services, “look and feel”, organization, compilation of the content, code, data, and all other elements of the website (collectively, the “FM Materials”)).  You acknowledge that the FM Materials are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws. All FM Materials are the copyrighted property of FM or its licensors, and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names associated with the website or otherwise contained in the FM Materials are proprietary to FM or its licensors. Except as expressly set forth herein, your use of the website does not grant you ownership of or any other rights with respect to any content, code, data, or other FM Materials that you may access on or through the website. We reserve all rights in and to the FM Materials that are not expressly granted to you in these Terms. For the sake of clarity, you understand and agree: (a) that your purchase of a Fragment, whether via the website or otherwise, does not give you any rights or licenses in or to the FM Materials (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the associated Art) other than those expressly contained in these Terms; (b) that you do not have the right, except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize any elements of the FM Materials (including, without limitation, any Art) without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold in our sole and absolute discretion; and (c) that you will not apply for, register, or otherwise use or attempt to use any FM trademarks or service marks, or any confusingly similar marks, anywhere in the world without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold at our sole and absolute discretion.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                C.  License to Art.  Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, FM grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased Fragments, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Purchased Fragments, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Fragment owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased Fragment to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Purchased Fragment, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Fragment’s owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased Fragment to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Fragment leaves the website/application.  
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                D. Restrictions.  You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without FM’s (or, as applicable, FM’s licensors’) express prior written consent in each case: (i) modify the Art for your Purchased Fragment in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes; (ii) use the Art for your Purchased Fragment to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service; (iii) use the Art for your Purchased Fragment in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (iv) use the Art for your Purchased Fragment in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in these Terms or solely for your own personal, non-commercial use; (v) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased Fragment; (vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Art for your Purchased Fragment; or (vii) otherwise utilize the Art for your Purchased Fragment for your or any third party’s commercial benefit. To the extent that Art associated with your Purchased Fragment contains Third Party IP, you understand and agree as follows: (x) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the license and restrictions contained herein; (y) that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, FM may need to pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the Art; and (z) to the extent that FM informs you of such additional restrictions in writing (email is permissible), you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of this license. The restrictions in this Section will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms. 
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                E. Other Terms of License.  The license granted in Section 4.C above applies only to the extent that you continue to Own the applicable Purchased Fragment. If at any time you sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased Fragment for any reason, the license granted in Section 4.C will immediately expire with respect to that Fragment without the requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for that Fragment.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                F.  Feedback.  You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the website, including without limitation about how to improve the website (collectively, “Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third parties (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise). You hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all rights necessary for us to incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>

You agree to use the website only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with these Terms and any applicable laws or regulations.

If we delete your Fragments’ images and descriptions from the website, such deletion will not affect your ownership rights in any NFTs that you already Own, but you will not receive a refund of any amounts you paid for those Fragments
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                A. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your Fragments, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of Fragments will not lose money.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                B. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Fragment-related transactions. FM is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the website.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                C. The website does not store, send, or receive Fragments. This is because Fragments exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the website’s supporting blockchain in the [(${TOKEN})] network. Any transfer of Fragments occurs within the supporting blockchain in the [(${TOKEN})] network, and not on the website.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
               D. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your electronic wallet. You accept and acknowledge that FM will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the [(${TOKEN})] network, however caused.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                E. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the FM Gallery ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of your Fragments.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
               F. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the FM Gallery ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of your Fragments.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                G. Upgrades to the [(${TOKEN})] platform, a hard fork in the [(${TOKEN})] platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the [(${TOKEN})] platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the [(${TOKEN})] NFT standard, including the FM Gallery ecosystem.

            <p>9.INDEMNIFICATION</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Please read this Section 15 carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with FM, its parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                All disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including without limitation your access or use of the website, or to any products sold or distributed through the website, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre. The appointing authority will be the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre. The case will be adjudicated by a single arbitrator and will be administered by the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre in accordance with its applicable rules. Each party will cover its own fees and costs associated with the arbitration proceedings; however, if the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the fees and costs reasonably associated with the arbitration proceedings, FM will pay them for you. The place of arbitration will be Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions. The language of the arbitration will be English. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FM may seek and obtain injunctive relief in any jurisdiction in any court of competent jurisdiction, and you agree that these Terms are specifically enforceable by FM through injunctive relief and other equitable remedies without proof of monetary damages.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>16.GENERAL</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                These Terms constitute the entire legal agreement between you and FM, govern your access to and use of the website, and completely replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties related to your access to or use of the website, whether oral or written. There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms create any agency, partnership, or joint venture. The language in these Terms will be interpreted as to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party. You may not assign any or your rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms in our sole discretion to an affiliate, or in connection with an acquisition, sale or merger. Should any part of these Terms be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such provision, nor of the right to enforce such provision. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the province of British Columbia, Canada and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding its conflicts of law rules and principles. Subject to Section 17, any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or provincial courts located in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the parties irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue there. We will not be liable for any failure or delayed performance of our obligations that result from any condition beyond our reasonable control, including, but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood, pandemic, acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, Internet disturbances, or acts or omissions of third parties. You agree that we may provide you with notices (including, without limitation those regarding changes to these Terms) by email, regular mail, or postings on the website. By providing us with your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices required by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.
